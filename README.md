# Invariant_kalman_fillter
A python implementation of right invariant kalman fillter; The case includes legged robots with IMU and contact sensors.


This is my course project for COMPSCI690K in UMASS Amherst. 

In this repository, I reimplemented the IEKF from [The Invariant Extended Kalman filter as a stable observerlink to a website][1].
